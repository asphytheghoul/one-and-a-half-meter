### 1. Node Features: `x=[92, 32]`
- **92 nodes total** in this graph
- Each node has **32 features**
- These features include:
  - For driver nodes: location coordinates, acceptance rates, experience, ratings, daily distance metrics, coin system data, and one-hot encoded categorical features (online status, trip status, etc.)
  - For passenger nodes: pickup/destination coordinates, trip details, ratings, preferences, and one-hot encoded categorical features
  - The last feature is the node type indicator (0 for drivers, 1 for passengers)

### 2. Edge Connections: `edge_index=[2, 100]`
- **100 edges** in the graph
- Format is `[2, 100]` where the first dimension (2) represents source and target nodes for each edge
- This represents 50 driver-passenger connections, with each connection represented in both directions (driver→passenger and passenger→driver)

### 3. Edge Features: `edge_attr=[100, 13]`
- Each of the 100 edges has **13 features**
- These features include:
  - Distance between driver and passenger
  - Estimated pickup time
  - Traffic factor
  - Base trip fare
  - Market surge factor
  - Passenger tip
  - Driver multiplier bonus
  - Total payment by passenger
  - Total earnings for driver
  - Effective multiplier
  - Compatibility score
  - Long distance pickup flag
  - Event awareness score

### 4. Edge Targets: `y=[100]`
- **100 target values**, one for each edge
- These are the normalized compatibility scores (ranging from 0 to 1)
- These values represent the likelihood of a successful match between a driver and passenger

### 6. Total Nodes: `num_nodes=92`
- Confirms we have 92 nodes total, which matches the first dimension of `x`
